## Introduction
By default, template services are exposed on the following ports:

| Service                 | Port      | Note        |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Frontend                | ``:8081`` |             |
| Project Template Server | ``:8082`` |             |
| Postgres                | ``:8083`` | Docker only |
| Keycloak                | ``:8089`` | Docker only |


<a name="prerequisities"></a>
## Prerequisites
Proper environment setup is crucial for the successful build and run of this project. Please follow the steps in the [environment and tools setup] documentation carefully.

To wrap up, the following [tools](./tool-versions.json) are required to build this project. Versions are maintained in `./tool-versions.json` file and follow [npm semver] versioning patterns.

<!--- VERSION_TABLE_START (Edit versions in tool-versions.json, not here. Do not delete this tag.) --->
| Tool                 | Version      | Note |
|----------------------|--------------|------|
| [JDK]                | '21'         |      |
| [Gradle]<sup>1</sup> | '>=8.5.x <9' |      |
| [Node]               | '22.x.x'     |      |
| [npm]<sup>1</sup>    | '>=10.7.x'   |      |
| [Docker]<sup>1</sup> | '>=20.x'     |      |
| [Docker Compose]     | '>=2.20.3'   |      |
<!--- VERSION_TABLE_END (Edit versions in tool-versions.json, not here. Do not delete this tag.) --->

<sup>1</sup>) These tools have to be configured to use proper Artifactory. Please, follow [Artifactory access] documentation to set it up.

<a name="quickstart"></a>
## Quickstart
Assuming you went through the documentation, your environment is set up and project is prepared, this is the most straightforward way to get your project application up and running:

**1. Build the application modules**  
    `gradle build`

**2. Run**
1. Project Template application
    1. Compose up the Keycloak container in Docker:  
        `gradle keycloakComposeUp`
        > **WARNING**: Project Template's Keycloak setup is for development purposes only. It is necessary to significantly enhance the security of a Keycloak instance for production environments.
    2. Run the server application with the default development Spring profile and keep it running:  
       `gradle :server:app:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env'`
       > **NOTE**: It is normal for the server startup progress to not quite reach 100% in the terminal output. Once you see the progress indicator hit around 80% or higher without any error logs, the server is running properly.
    3. Run client:
        1. In another terminal window, move to client directory with `cd client`.
        2. Then start the webpack with `npm start` and keep it running.
2. Project Template init application (for initialization and migration purposes)
   > **WARNING**: Before running the init application, make sure to stop the server application first. The init application will lock the Postgres database during initialization, and the database could become inconsistent if data is being initialized while the server is still running.
   - Run the init application with the default development Spring profile:  
          `gradle :server:init:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env'`
   - Run the init application with the 'init-data' Spring profile additionally to initialize documents based on the `import/data/request` folder:
          `gradle :server:init:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-env,init-data'`  

**3. Explore the application**  
The frontend is, by default, running on http://localhost:8081.  

There are three test users with credentials:

- `admin` / `A12PT-admintest` for Admin role
- `user1` / `A12PT-user1test` for User role
- `user2` / `A12PT-user2test` for User role

Log in with one of these credentials and take a look over the content.
> **WARNING**: Project Template's login setup is for development purposes only. It is necessary to significantly enhance the security of logins and user management for production environments.
